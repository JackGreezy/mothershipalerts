# supplements

STEP 1: GIT CLONE https://github.com/michaelzhao820/supplements.git (ONLY NEED TO DO ONCE, THIS WILL PUT IT ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE)
STEP 2: make your edits to any way you see deem fit
STEP 3: make sure to push your code back into the repository, we can look over it every week and see how it goes


To run the front end, cd all the way into supplements-frontend, and then do npm install (ONLY NEED TO DO ONCE). Then from there type npm run dev.
I haven't really done anything for the backend, I think it's a good exercise to try to integrate Flask, Scraper, MongoDB. Let me know how it goes in a
week.
